<h4>I designed and assembled a custom desktop PC from individual components such as: </h4>
 <p>
 -  CPU, RAM, and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) </br>
 -  Solid state Drive (SSD), and Hard drives (HDD) </br>
 -  Motherboard, Fans and Power Supply unit (PSU) </br>
 -  WiFi/Bluetooth Adapter</br>
 -  Case
 </p>

 <h4>Key Activities:</h4>
 <p>
    - Researched and selected compatible components based on budget, performance needs, and compatibility </br>
    - Assembled components, ensuring proper installation and connections </br>
    - Installed and configured operating systems (dual boot) and necessary drivers </br>
    - Conducted performance testing and troubleshooting to ensure optimal functionality </br>
    - Set up a virtualized lab environment (Virtual Box) for learning and experimentation </br>


<h4>With the skills I acquired from this, I have assisted people in building their own PCs, 
    and I can replace or upgrade components as needed.
