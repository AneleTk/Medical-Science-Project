<h4>Protein Purification</h4>

 <p>Following transfection, the expressed antibody was purified using affinity chromatography. The transfection culture was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4500 x g at 4°C. 
    The cell pellet was discarded, and the supernatant containing the monoclonal antibody was transferred into a sterile flask. A 0.45 μm filter and syringe were used to filter the supernatant. </p>

 <p>Into a 14 cm Bio-rad Econo-Pac column attached to a retort stand, 2.5 ml of thoroughly mixed Protein A beads were added and allowed to settle at the bottom. The column was then equilibrated with 3 column volumes of Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 
    The supernatant was loaded into the column to pass through. The column was again washed with 3 column volumes of PBS afterward.</p>

 <p>To elute the bound antibody from the Protein A beads in the column, 12.6 ml of elution buffer was added into the column and allowed to flow through directly into a tube containing 1.4 ml of neutralization buffer prepared prior. 
    The column was again washed with 3 column volumes of PBS. The process of loading the supernatant into the column to antibody elution was repeated twice.</p>

 <p>The eluted antibody was concentrated in 10 000 MWCO Amicon® Ultra 15ml centrifugal tubes by centrifuging at 4500 x g at 4°C.  PBS buffer was used for the buffer exchange. 
    The protein concentration was then measured using a Nanodrop™ 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA).</p>
