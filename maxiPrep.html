<h4>Plasmid DNA Purification</h4>

 <p>After plasmid verification (Section 4.2), a PureLink™ HiPure Plasmid Filter Maxiprep kit (Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA) was used to purify the plasmid DNA from the bacterial cells. 
  To prepare a sub-culture, LB broth was prepared, autoclaved for 40 minutes, and supplemented with kanamycin. 2 ml of the previous overnight culture was then added to the LB broth and incubated at 37°C overnight on a shaker.
</p>

 <p>
To equilibrate the PureLink™ Column, 30 ml of Equilibration Buffer (EQ1) was added into the Filtration Cartridge inside the column and allowed to drain by gravity flow. The sub-culture was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4000 x g. 
After discarding the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of Resuspension Buffer (R3). The cells were then lysed by adding 10 ml of Lysis Buffer (L7), mixing gently by inverting, and incubating for 5 minutes at room temperature. After incubation, 10 ml of Precipitation Buffer (N3) was added and promptly mixed by inverting. 
The precipitated lysate was then immediately transferred into the pre-equilibrated column and allowed to drain by gravity flow. 
The column was washed by adding 10 ml of Wash Buffer (W8), and the inner filtration cartridge was discarded afterward. The column was again washed with 50 ml of Wash Buffer (W8). 
The flow-through was discarded after draining the buffer. A sterile 50 ml centrifuge tube was then placed under the column, and 15 ml of Elution Buffer (E4) was added to the column. The solution containing the purified DNA was allowed to drain by gravity flow.
</p>

 <p>To precipitate the DNA, 10.5 ml of room-temperature isopropanol was added to the eluate and mixed by inverting. The tube was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 1.5 hours at 4°C. After discarding the supernatant, 5 ml of 70% ethanol was added to the pellet. 
  The tube was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 1 hour at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, then the pellet was air-dried for 10 minutes. Finally, 200 μl of TE buffer was added to resuspend the pellet. The purified plasmid DNA was then transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. 
  The DNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop™ 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA).</p>
