<h4>Plasmid DNA Purification</h4>

 <p>A PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep kit (Promega, USA) was used to purify the plasmid DNA from the bacterial cells.
   1.5 ml of the overnight culture was centrifuged for 30 seconds at 1400 x g. After discarding the supernatant, 
   an additional 1.5 ml of the culture was added to the same tube and centrifuged.</p>

 <p>The supernatant was again discarded, then 600 µl of nuclease-free water was added to resuspend the cell pellet. 
  To release the plasmid DNA, 100 µl of Cell Lysis Buffer was added, and the tube was inverted six times. 
  350 µl of cold (4-8°C) Neutralization solution was also added, and the contents were mixed again by inverting the tube. 
  The mixture was centrifuged at 1400 x g for 3 minutes. </p>

 <p>The supernatant was then transferred into a PureYield™ Minicolumn placed inside a Collection Tube and subsequently centrifuged at 1400 x g for 1 minute. 
  For washing, 200 µl of Endotoxin Removal Wash was added to the minicolumn and centrifuged at 1400 x g for 1 minute. 
  400 µl of Column Wash Solution was also added and centrifuged for 1 minute at 1400 x g. 
  The minicolumn was then transferred into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.</p>

 <p>To elute the plasmid, 30 µl of Elution Buffer was added and 
  left to stand at room temperature for 1 minute and then centrifuged at 1400 x g for 15 seconds.</p>

 <p>The plasmid DNA concentration was then determined using a Nanodrop™ 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA). 
  The plasmid was stored at -20°C. Miniprep was done for both LC and HC plasmids, in parallel</p>
  
 

<h5>Key skills applied & strengthened:</h5>
<p>
- Using a miniprep kit to extract and purify plasmid DNA from bacterial cells.<br>
- Centrifugation techniques for separating cellular components.<br>
- Measurement of DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop).<br>
