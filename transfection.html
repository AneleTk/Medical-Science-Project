<h4>Transfection of 293-F cells with LC & HC chain plasmids</h4>

 <p>293-F cells were maintained every 2-3 days. The cells were sub-cultured when the density was between 1-3x106 viable cells/ml in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks with vented caps. 
    To determine the cell density, 10 μl of 0.4% trypan blue (Thermo Scientific, USA) was mixed with 10 μl of the cell culture. Then 10 μl of the mixture was loaded into a counting chamber which was placed into a Countess II cell counter (Invitrogen, USA). 
    The split ratio for seeding at 0.2x10 cells/ml was calculated, then fresh pre-warmed FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium (Thermo Scientific, USA) of the appropriate volume was added to dilute the cells. 
    The cells were then incubated at 37°C in an 8% CO2  shaking incubator. 
</p>

 <p>One day prior to transfection, 100 ml cells were prepared and seeded at 1x106 viable cells/ml. On transfection day, 300 μl of Polyethylenimine “Max” (PEI-MAX) and 5 ml of OptiPRO™ SFM (Thermo Scientific, USA) were mixed in a sterile 15 ml conical tube. 
    In another tube, 50 μg of purified light plasmid DNA and 50 μg of purified heavy chain plasmid DNA were mixed with 5 ml of OptiPRO™ SFM. This mixture was then filter sterilized using a 0.22 μm filter directly into the PEI-MAX/OptiPRO™ mixture. 
    The transfection mixture was then vortexed and incubated in the hood for 20 minutes to allow the PEI-MAX and DNA to complex. 
</p>

 <p>Afterward, the mixture was added to the 100 ml cell culture while gently shaking the flask. The cell culture was incubated in the hood for 20 minutes to allow the DNA liposomes to enter the cells. 
    Lastly, the culture was incubated at 37°C in an 8% CO2 shaking incubator for three days (72 hours).</p>
