<h4>E.coli transformation</h4>

 <p>Available at the laboratory was one VRC03 recombinant plasmid DNA which encoded for a light chain (LC) of the IgG monoclonal antibody to be expressed, and another VRC03 plasmid which encoded for a heavy chain (HC) of the antibody. 
  The plasmid also had a gene for kanamycin resistance. </p>

 <p> Agar was prepared prior to transformation. It was subsequently autoclaved for 40 minutes, supplemented with kanamycin, and transferred to Petri dishes. 
  10-beta e.coli competent cells (New England BioLabs®) were removed from the -80°C freezer to thaw on ice. 3 μl containing 100 ng of the LC recombinant plasmid DNA was added to 50 μl of the competent cells. 
  The tube was mixed gently by flicking and then placed back on ice for 30 minutes. The cells were then heat-shocked by placing the tube in a heating block at 42°C for 30 seconds. 
  After that, the tube was removed and placed back on ice for 5 minutes.</p>
  
 <p>For cell recovery, 950 μl of room temperature Stable Outgrowth medium (New England BioLabs®) was added to the tube, and the tube was placed at 37°C on a shaker (200 rpm) for 1 hour. 
  Thereafter, 100 μl of the mixture was aseptically (near an open flame) plated and spread evenly across the warm agar plate prepared prior. Finally, the plates were incubated at 37°C overnight. 
  Transformation was also performed using the HC recombinant plasmid, in parallel.</p>

<h5>Key skills applied & strengthened:</h5>
<p>
- Performing bacterial transformation using heat-shock method</br>
- Preparing and autoclaving agar plates</br>
- Aseptic techniques for plating transformed cells</br>
- Incubation and growth of transformed bacterial colonies</br>
